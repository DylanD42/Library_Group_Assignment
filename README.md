Hello! Welcome to our Library program.

Whenever you run the program, you will use the excutable: ./book

We used a switch case method in main to allow you, the user, to choose how you'd like
to interact with our Library service, which includes the following options:

Reading from a file -- Choose input.txt for a nice variety of books that includes the title, author, page count, ISBN,
shelf price, and year published information attached. 

Write the library to a file -- This would be you creating a new file for the library data to be put into.

Print the library -- This would print the library you've modified or interacted with, at least.

Search for a specific book -- You would search by inputing the book's title. If the title is in the library, the book's
information will be provided. Otherwise, we will let you know if it cannot be found. 

Search for books by a specific author -- You would search by inputing the author's full name.

Add an entry via "donation"  -- You would add a new entry to the library by inputing the author's full name, followed
by all other relevant information that you are asked to enter.

Delete an entry due to a book being "missing" -- You would delete an already existing entry from the library by
submitting the book's information.

Exit the program -- Whenever you're done interacting, select 8 to leave.


NOTES:

We have included a list of book entries for a library under the file named: input.txt

Thank you!!
